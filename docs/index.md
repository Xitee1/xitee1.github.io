# Welcome!
Welcome to my new documentation page!

This is my new home page where I will publish all my documentations that I've written while trying out some things.
Expect many articles about everything computer related soon!

Please note that english is not my primary language, so expect some grammar issues here and there.
You are welcome to open an issue in the repo about no matter how small mistake you encounter, or even better, open a pull request.
This will also help me to improve my english skills :smile:
